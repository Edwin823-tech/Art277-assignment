    <h1>Can Vaccinated People Transmit COVID-19 to others?</h1>
    <p>Get the answer from an infectious disease specialist</p>
    <img src="aa.jpg">
    <p>We have heard it since the pendemic started-lemon juice can kill the coronavirus,mask don't work, if you already
        had <a href="#c4">COVID-19</a> you can't get it again or that the vaccines approved for emergncy use will change
        your DNA or put a
        tricking device on your body.</p>
    <a href="#c4">Send Us Email</a>
    <p>It's almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the missinformation. But despite all the
        myths and urban legends, about about half of the U.S. population os fully vaccinated. Wonderful news, right?</p>
    <p>Well, not to some. Vaccinated People are up against a new set of myths - they're literally magnetic or they're
        going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of
        protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone els.</p>
    <p>So what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to
        others? infectious disease specialist <a href="#c4">Lyssette Cardona,</a>MD, answers those questions and covers
        why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the foght against COVID-19. </p>

    <h1> "Fully vaccinated" doesn't mean "immune to COVID-19"</h1>
    <p>
        As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
        feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
        down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected.</p>
    <p> Dr. Cardona explains.</p>
    <p> “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best protection
        against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% protection against
        illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being exposed to the
        SARS-CoV2 virus.”</p>
