        <p style="font-size: 20px;">It is also important not share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to regonize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use omly.</p>
        <li>Cover youur mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</li>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">SARS_C0V_2 is found in high amount on the mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk.

        <li>Do not gather in group</li>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Being in a group or gathering make it more likely that you will be in close contact with someone. This include aoiding all religious places of wordhip,as you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also includes not congregating at parks of beaches. </p>
        <li>Avoid eating or drinking in public places</li>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means Avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars,and other eatries. The virus can be transmitted through food, utemsil, dishes , and cups. it ma also be temporarily airbome from other people in the venue. You can still get delivary or takeway food. Choose food that are thoroughly cooked and can be reheated. High heat (at least 132 degree feriheit or 56 degree centigray,according to one recent,not-yet-peer-reviewed lab study) help to kill corona viruses. This means it may be best to avoid cool water from restaurants and all food from buffets and open salad bars.</p>
        <li>Wash fresh groceries</li>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Wash all produce under running waters before eating or preapring. the CDC Trusted source and the FDA Trusted Sources do not recommend using soap,detergent,or commercial produce wash on things like fruits and vegetables. Be sure to wash hands before and after handling these items.</p>
        <li>Wear a home mask</li>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The center for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommends Trusted Source that almost everyone wears a cloth face mask in public setting whrer physical standing may be difficult such as grocery stores. when used correctly, these masks can help prevent people who are asymptomic or undiagnosed from transmitting SARS_C0V_2 when they breath, talk, sneeze or cough. This, in turn slows the transmission of the virus. The CDC website provides instructions Trusted Source for making tour own mask at home, using basic materials such as T-shirt and scissors. Some pointers to keep in mind:</p>
        <ol type="a" style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li>wearing a mask alone will not prevent from getting a SARS_C0V_2 infection. careful hand washing and physical distancing must also be followed.</li>
            <li>cloth mask are not as effective as other types of mask, such as surgical mask or N95 respirators. How ever, these other mask should be reserved for health care workers and first responders.</li>
            <li>wash your hands before you put on your mask.</li>
            <li>You can transfer the virus from the  your hands to the mask. If you are wearing a mask, avoid touching the front of it. </li>
            <li>You can also tranfer the virus from the mask to your hands. wash your hands if you touch the front of it</li>
            <li>A mask should not be worn by a child under two years od, a person who has trouble breathing, or a preson who can not remove the mask on their own.</li>

        </ol>

        <li>Self-quarantine if sick</li>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> call your doctor if you have any symptoms. stay home until you recover. Avoid sitting, sleeping, or eating with your loved ones even if you live in the same home.
