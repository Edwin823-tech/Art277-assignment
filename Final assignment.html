         <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
           <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<u> Lorem Isump</u> had been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.It has survived not only five countries,but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remainning essentially unchanged. It was popularisedin the 1960s with the released of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passage,and more resently with desktop publishing software like <em><strong><u>Aldus Pagemaker</em></strong></u> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<font font-text="arial narrow" Color="black">1914 translation by H.Rackham</font></div>

       <h1>Why do we used it?</h1>
           It is long esstblished fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <q> conten here, content here </q>, making it look like readable English.Many desktop publishing pakages and web page editors now used Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for "Lorem Ipsum" wwill uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various version have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose(injected humour and the like)

        <p> <h1>Where can I get some?

        </h1><strong>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Isump available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u>radomized words</u>which don't look even slighly belieavable.</strong>If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Isump you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing  hiddenin the middle of text.<i>All the Lorem Isump generation on the Internet.</i>It uses a dictionary of over 200 latin words combimed with a handful of model sentence structure, to generate Lorem Isup which look reasonable. The generated Lorem Isump is therefore always free from repetition, inkected humor,or non characteristic words etc.</p>
